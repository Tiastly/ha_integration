# ePlateController

**StudienArbeit**

this is a Homeassistant integration, combine with an esp32 and Display to use (where is it, idküò¥), so we could say, this part is an information-gather and publisher (MQTT)

the information consists of 3 parts, 
- **lecture**: the Schedule table from electronic faculty Ostfalia (SpulseEins API)
> because the api was semester based, so in avoid of too many requests every day this program will only refresh one time every day in order to keep the latest timetable. and other requests will only be looked up locally. the newest information every day will be found in files `room\\roomplan-{date}.json`
- partly **text descriptions** or url
  user input

- more **text** in office-mode

- **sensors**:
  user select, must first be added in Homeassistant

  ‚ö† check the **type of sensor** `sensor device classes` before you add other sensors, otherwise it could  probably not be shown
